Simple Score leaderboard command line "app" for keeping users and scores 

(Used this as a example project to learn some basic Rust.) 

Creates a user.txt file to store all the player/users 
and sorts them according to the score 
any changes are saved immediately to the txt file, nothing special 

feel free to add your own functionality!
